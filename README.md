# -Website-Phising-Detection
Phishing attacks are a big cybersecurity problem where fake websites pretend to be real ones to steal personal information. Traditional methods that rely on fixed rules often fail because phishing techniques keep changing. This project aims to create a smart system using machine learning to detect phishing websites by analysing their URLs and content.


Phishing attacks are growing threats in cybersecurity. This project uses supervised learning techniques to predict whether a website is **legitimate** or **phishing**, based on extracted features like:

- Presence of HTTPS
- Anchor tags
- Use of IP address
- Subdomain structure
- Website forwarding and redirects
- Google indexing, page rank, and more

 
 
 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classifier
- Tensor Flow Keras Model
