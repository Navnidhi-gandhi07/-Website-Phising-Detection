# -Website-Phising-Detection
Phishing attacks are a big cybersecurity problem where fake websites pretend to be real ones to steal personal information. Traditional methods that rely on fixed rules often fail because phishing techniques keep changing. This project aims to create a smart system using machine learning to detect phishing websites by analysing their URLs and content.
